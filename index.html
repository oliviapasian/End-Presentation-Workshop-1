            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">At the start of the semester, I was interested in exploring the ideas of isolation and connection during the pandemic and using a combination of digital and real life interactions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">  I thought that would end up looking like some kind of web experience or game at the end of the semester, but I didn’t really know how to go about that.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> <b> Project 1:</b> I figured that since I wanted to do some kind of digital interaction or game, I would need to brush up on my coding skills, so I made a series of web experiments based on skill-building for Project 1. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> I learned a lot about coding, but I let the conceptual ideas for my thesis and research to take a backseat to focus on practical and technical skills. </p>

            <div class="card"><p class="itemtext">In my midterm presentation, I pointed out the gaps in my project, which were that I needed to spend more time on research and develop my thesis idea further. </p></div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> At the time of the presentation, I was nudged a bit away from the idea of digital and physical interaction and more towards how online games can fill a need for human connection and how this idea has evolved from the past, to present post-pandemic life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">The game-focused idea did not end up lasting very long, but it was a shift away from my original ideas about focusing specifically on the pandemic. However, the idea of old online games did take me a step closer to the idea of old web communities which is where I ended up in after the Midterm Presentation. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> For my presentation, I focused on Frank Chimero’s essay “What Screens Want”. I was really interested in how it spoke about the web being unfriendly to users and reinventing the web to benefit people more than corporations. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> "What Screens Want" and other research I did at the same time got me thinking more about how the I feel about the web and led me to consider my topic more. The web was supposed to be this great thing where people could connect and build community and share ideas, but it's so commercialised and unfriendly now. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> I had been sure about my games-based idea after the Midterm Presentation. Then, after the Reading Presentation, I changed directions again. But each time I have altered my idea, it has become something I am more interested in and with a more clear and supported focus.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">While working on my Reading Presentation, I was introduced to the decentralised web movement and I reflected on the relationship between humans and screens.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> 
                    The decentralised web movement is basically about connecting people, projects, and protocols that can help build a web that returns to its original ideology. It is about users having more control over their data and spreading the power among users rather than leaving the web in the hands of a select few companies.

            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> I also got interested in small social media through an <a target="_blank" href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/a-software-engineers-advice-for-saving-social-media-keep-it-small/">AIGA article</a> about Darius Kazemi, an artist and programmer, and his social media site "Friend Camp". Things like "Friend Camp" and designers who are creating user-centred spaces is exactly the kind of thing I am interested in. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">Finally, another big inspiration for my research is GeoCities. This web hosting service no longer exists but it's an inspiration to me for the kinds of web interactions I want to design, based on creating community and offering opportunities for self-expression. </p>

            <div class="card"><div class="resizingtext">  <h2 class="itemtitle">PROJECT 2</h2></div></div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> I decided to make a series of web experiments, like I had done for Project 1, but these would be software interactions with a stronger conceptual focus and be centered on counter-acting human isolation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">For my first software interaction, I made a self-portrait website where anyone can draw a picture of themselves and post it to the website for everyone else to see. I wanted to make this as a way for the user to have a visible impact on the website and show all the "faces" of the people who had visited the website previously. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">The self-portrait website took me a long time because I had to learn so many new coding skills for it. I had wanted to focus less on the technical side of things after I neglected the conceptual in Project 1, but I learned a lot of skills for this that I will be need to make more interactions related to my topic.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">For my next software interaction, I wanted to use websockets, which would allow each user to see real-time changes another user was making to the website. I wanted to create a collaborative effort where people could work together to spell things out with "magnet" words.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> I didn't come out of Project 2 with as much work as I wanted to have done, but there is a lot I am looking forward to exploring in the new year. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> On the technical side, I'd love to do more with websockets, and explore how I can continue using them to develop my topic. I also want to move away from the pattern of small web experiments that I've done this semester and try to make some larger, more finished works. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext"> Next semester, my goals are to start off building up my research more, bringing all my topics together under the umbrella of community on the web and creating spaces that are about self-expression and connection, and building off of the website ideas I had this semester to make more cool stuff.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="itemtext">I learned so much this semester and I am looking forward to seeing where my research leads me next semester!</p>
